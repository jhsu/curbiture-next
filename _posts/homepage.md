It solves this problem by creating a free service that makes everyone aware of the free stuff on the street through a map web app.

Curbiture is a web app that allows users to post and find free items in NYC to be used and be picked up by others. In a way, it's like Craiglist or Freecycle but focuses on furniture specifically. We hope people will not opt for the landfill option by using this app.
