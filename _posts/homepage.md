Curbiture exists as a free service allowing everyone to discover free things on the street through a map.

Share items you come across while walking around NYC and discover items others have found. In a way, it's like Craiglist or Freecycle but focuses on furniture specifically.

We hope Curbiture will help encourage reuse before things reach the landfill.
