Curbiture is a service for residents of New York City to share, discover and pickup free furniture. Most of it goes to waste in the landfill because people don't know there is free furniture out there or what condition it is in.

It solves this problem by creating a free service that makes everyone aware of the free stuff on the street through a map web app.

Curbiture is a web app that allows users to post and find free items in NYC to be used and be picked up by others. In a way, it's like Craiglist or Freecycle but focuses on furniture specifically. We hope people will not opt for the landfill option by using this app.
